# Intorudction

The aim of this project is to observe the evolution of meteorological parameters to demonstrate the impacts of Climate Change. The study focus on Pyrénées-Orientales department of France, in the south (main city is Perpignan).

## Data

The first part is focus on Meteo France in-situ observations registered by the Rivesaltes station.
In a second time, reanalysis data from Era5 are studied in order to observe an "average" climate of Perpignan. To do that, four points of grid are averaged in order to produce only one data.

### Parameters

The parameters, at an hourly frequency, from Rivesaltes station used in this study are the following one:

- Temperature, TX (maximal temperature) and TN (minimal temperature) in °C
- Total rainfall in mm/1h
- Relative Humidity in %
- Wind in m/s, average power over 10mn at 10m high
- Wind gust max speed in m/s during the hour, at 10m high

The parameters from Era5 ranalysis are at an hourly frequency:

- Temperature in K
- U wind component at 10m high
- V wind component at 10m high
